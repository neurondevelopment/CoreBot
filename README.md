<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* NodeJS >= v16.13.0
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo or download the files
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/neurondevelopment/CoreBot.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Fill in the information in `config.json`, the following fields are required for the bot to start
   ```js
   token serverID
   ```
4. Invite or reinvite the bot with the following link, replace YOURCLIENTID with the Client ID of your bot
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOURCLIENTID&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot
   ```
5. In the discord developer dashboard, where you created your bot and got its token, scroll down to 'Privileged Gateway Intents' and tick the SERVER MEMBERS and MESSAGE CONTENT intent.
6. Starting the bot
   ```sh
   node .
   ```
   **OR**
   
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   
### Permissions
By default, every command is open for everyone, except for moderation commands. If you have not set any perms for the moderation commands, they will default to the Administrator permission.  
In each command file, there is an array called perms, it looks like perms: []
Inside, you can add either a role ID or a permission to use that command, a role id looking like "843429294848081920", or a permission looking like "Administrator"

The final array should look something like
```js
perms: ["843429294848081920", "ManageMessages"]
```
This will allow anyone with the role that has the ID 843429294848081920, or anyone with the manage messages permission to run this command

You can find Discord's list of permissions [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags)
All permission names must be converted from SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE to PascalCase to work. For example MANAGE_MESSAGES should be ManageMessages

### Bot Status
In your config.json, find the status section and use one of the types found [here](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ActivityType) . Note that not all types will work.

### Autoroles
Simply add the role IDs to the array "autoroles" in the config.json. For example "autoroles": ["RoleID1", "RoleID2"]

### Dropdown Roles
They can be set / updated by running the `/sync` command


Dropdown Roles can be found in /db/dropdownRoles.json

```js
"123456789": { // Enter the channel ID for the embed to be sent to
        "message": "Get your roles below", // Message on the embed
        "roles": {
            "roleName": { // The name of the role shown in the dropdown menu
                "description": "description",
                "emoji": "",
                "roles": [""] // The roles that this option will provide, specify the role IDs
            }
        },
        "donttouch": "" // Message ID of the embed, will be filled out automatically by the bot
    }
```
<br>

### Tickets
They can be set / updated by running the `/sync` command

Tickets can be found in /db/tickets.json

```js
{
    "exampleTicket": { // Name of the ticket, will be shown on the embed
        "donttouch": "", // Message ID of the embed, will be filled out automatically by the bot
        "messageChannelID": "", // The ID of the channel that the embed will be sent to
        "categoryID": "", // The ID of the category that tickets will be added to
        "supportroles": [""], // The support roles for this ticket type, will be able to claim tickets. Specify their Role IDs
        "message": "Welcome to your ticket {[USER]}", // Message sent when the ticket is opened, use {[USER]} to ping the user
        "closeMessage": "Your ticket has been closed", // Message sent to the user via DMs when their ticket is closed
        "embed": {
            "description": "This is an example ticket, click the button below to create!",
            "colour": "AQUA",
            "image": ""
        },
        "button": {
            "label": "Open Ticket",
            "buttonStyle": "SECONDARY",
            "emoji": "ðŸŽ«"
        }
    }
}
```
### Global Commands
Some users may find they need to use global commands instead of guild commands, so that they can use the commands in multiple servers. Below is a simple guide for that, just note that any updates to commands will take ~1 hour to update in discord's cache when using global commands.

In the index.js, replace `Routes.applicationGuildCommands(client.user.id, serverID)` with `Routes.applicationCommands(client.user.id)`, make sure you don't accidentally remove the comma after it either.
